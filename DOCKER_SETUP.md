# üê≥ Docker Local Setup Guide

## What You Need to Install Docker:

### 1. Download Docker Desktop
- Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Download "Docker Desktop for Windows"
- File size: ~500MB

### 2. Installation Requirements
Your Windows system needs:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Virtualization enabled in BIOS
- At least 4GB RAM

### 3. Installation Steps
1. Run Docker Desktop installer as Administrator
2. Check "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" (important!)
3. Complete installation
4. Restart computer
5. Start Docker Desktop

### 4. After Installation, Run These Commands:
```bash
# Test Docker installation
docker --version

# Build your app
docker compose up --build

# Access app at: http://localhost:3000
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Installation Issues:
- **BIOS Virtualization**: Must be enabled
- **WSL 2**: Must be installed first
- **Windows Version**: Must be recent enough
- **Antivirus**: May block installation

## Time Required:
- Download: 10-15 minutes
- Installation: 10-20 minutes  
- Setup: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 30-45 minutes**

## Alternative: Skip Docker, Use Railway
If Docker installation fails or takes too long, Railway deployment is much faster and requires no local setup.
