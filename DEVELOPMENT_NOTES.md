## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Development

### Fixed Issues:
- ✅ **Pie chart not rendering on mobile** - CSS transform issue with viewport
- ✅ **Login form breaking with special characters** - Added proper input validation
- ✅ **Database connection timeout** - Implemented connection pooling
- ✅ **Charts not updating after expense deletion** - Fixed state management
- ✅ **Mobile keyboard pushing layout up** - Added viewport meta tag fixes

### Current Known Issues:
- [ ] **Performance with 100+ expenses** - Need to implement pagination
- [ ] **Date picker looks different on Safari** - Need cross-browser testing
- [ ] **Category colors sometimes clash** - Should implement better color algorithm

## 💡 Things I Learned (The Hard Way)

### CSS Discoveries:
- CSS Grid is amazing once you understand it
- `conic-gradient()` can create beautiful pie charts
- CSS custom properties (variables) make theming so much easier
- `backdrop-filter` creates that nice glassmorphism effect

### JavaScript Lessons:
- Async/await is cleaner than Promise chains
- Input validation is crucial (learned this from user feedback)
- localStorage has size limits (discovered at 5MB)
- Fetch API error handling is trickier than expected

### Database Insights:
- PostgreSQL is way more powerful than I initially thought
- SQL joins still make my brain hurt sometimes
- Database migrations are important (learned this the hard way)
- Connection pooling prevents timeouts

### Deployment Drama:
- Environment variables are case-sensitive on Vercel
- CORS configuration took me 3 days to get right
- Static file serving needs proper paths
- Always test in production environment

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Next Features to Add:
- [ ] **Export to CSV** - Users keep asking for this
- [ ] **Recurring expenses** - Monthly rent, subscriptions, etc.
- [ ] **Budget alerts** - Email notifications when over budget
- [ ] **Dark mode toggle** - Because everyone loves dark mode
- [ ] **Expense photos** - Upload receipts (maybe with Cloudinary)

### Technical Debt:
- [ ] **Add proper tests** - Currently testing manually (bad practice!)
- [ ] **Error boundary component** - Better error handling
- [ ] **API rate limiting** - Prevent abuse
- [ ] **Database query optimization** - Some queries are slow
- [ ] **Code splitting** - Bundle is getting large

### Mobile App Ideas:
- [ ] **React Native version** - Native mobile experience
- [ ] **PWA features** - Offline support, push notifications
- [ ] **Camera integration** - Quick expense entry with photos

## 🤔 Decisions Made & Why

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?
- Wanted to understand fundamentals before using frameworks
- Smaller bundle size and faster loading
- No dependency management headaches
- Easier to debug and maintain

### Why PostgreSQL over MongoDB?
- Better for relational data (users, expenses, categories)
- ACID compliance for financial data
- More familiar SQL syntax
- Better performance for complex queries

### Why Vercel over Other Platforms?
- Easy GitHub integration
- Automatic deployments
- Great performance with CDN
- Generous free tier

### Why CSS Charts over Chart.js?
- Smaller bundle size
- Better performance (no library overhead)
- More control over styling
- Fun challenge to implement myself

## 📊 Current Stats
- **Lines of Code:** ~1000 JavaScript, ~800 CSS
- **Bundle Size:** ~45KB (pretty good!)
- **Performance Score:** 95+ on Lighthouse
- **Mobile Responsive:** ✅ Tested on 5+ devices
- **Browser Support:** Chrome ✅, Firefox ✅, Safari ✅, Edge ✅
